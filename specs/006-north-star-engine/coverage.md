# Coverage — North Star engine

> Traceability matrix = source of truth for the state of each criterion and gap detector.
> Rule: every objective → a criterion; every criterion → an eval/UAT. Orphan row = gap.
> Chain: **pillar → objective → criterion** via the mapping in `alignment.md` (`aligned`).

**Status legend:** `no contract` → `🔴 red` → `🟢 green` → `✅ uat`  ·
`📋 case` (non-deterministic) · `[given]` (inherited from constitution) · `deferred` (justified gap)

No `base/pattern` applies as `[given]`: the engine is a stateless dev-time function library
(no write endpoints, retries/webhooks/payments, or network surface) — audit-logging /
idempotency / rate-limiting do not fire.

Implementation done: **all 18 criteria 🟢 GREEN** (`bash tests/run.sh` → 181 PASS, 0 FAIL).
The 19th, `GATE-REGRESSION`, stays 🟢 green — `check_95` passed unchanged after the rewire,
confirming the gate's behavior is identical (engine calls swapped in, no semantic change).
BUILD ✅ (18/18 deterministic green); ready for `/verify` (+ trajectory) and `/uat`.

| `agnostic-portability` | Self-check green | Suite exercises the engine and stays green | SELF-CHECK | project | `tests/run.sh` + `check_82_north_star_engine.sh` | 🟢 green |

**No orphan rows:** every brief objective (O1 in-repo engine, O2 gate reuse, O3
dependency-free, + self-check green) maps to ≥1 criterion with a pillar; every criterion
has a deterministic test. Spec freezable.

**Invariant tied to deliverable:** `DEP-FREE` is bound to the engine existing at
`scripts/north-star/engine.py` and importing only stdlib (not a repo-wide
green-by-construction guardrail) — so it has a genuine RED→GREEN arc (`/contract` proves it
RED because the module does not exist yet).
